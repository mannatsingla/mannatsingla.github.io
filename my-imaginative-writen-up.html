          The importance of mother in my life is that she is an advisor and a trainer for me. As she teaches me and guides me the pros and cons of life. Mother is the biggest gist I have ever received.As for me, my mom is my best friend
          whom I can share my each and every secret of my life.I love and admire her as she gave me most inportant thing that is life. I think that I am the most blessed child in the world.
          As god has gifted me a loving and most caring mother.
          <br>
          We can make our mother feel special and loved by treating her with utmost dignity and honour.
          <br>
          Each of one us make very marvlous cards for our hardworking mom. But making cards is not something that we are doing to make our mother feel special. It's good to make cards as we are showing our talent, creativity and love towards our mom. But we must also be grateful to her and should always
          vocalize magical words like please, thank you and sorry. We must also mutter the gigantic miraculous words to her that I love you mom.
