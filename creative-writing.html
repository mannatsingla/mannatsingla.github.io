          The nature mesmerizes me. Once I get into the beauty of nature I am mesmerzed completely. This nature is comprised of miracles. Think how creatures occured, before that how plants
          came after that a new form of animals came humans that is us. so a world full of miracles mesmerizes me more than anything else. The fragnance of roses mesmerizes me very much. I am completely hypnotized by NATURE.
